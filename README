Vim navigation for New York Times' Article Skimmer

Like vim there are two modes: source mode and story mode. You start off in source mode, which allows you to navigate the left nav column using 'j' and 'k'. To enter story mode, press 'i'. You can then navigate the stories with 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l'. If you find a story you like, highlight it and press enter to go to read the story. Go back to source mode pressing escape.
